This hasn't been tested on\r\nmany systems so let us know if you have trouble.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a Linux ELF shared lib instead of the non-shared .a\r\nfile see the notes in the Makefile.\r\n\r\nIf you want to build with Motif support, edit Makefile.X11, looking\r\nfor the \"Motif\" information.\r\n\r\nThe SGI copyright is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n * (c) Copyright 1993, Silicon Graphics, Inc.\r\n * ALL RIGHTS RESERVED \r\n * Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for \r\n * any purpose and without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above\r\n * copyright notice appear in all copies and that both the copyright notice\r\n * and this permission notice appear in supporting documentation, and that \r\n * the name of Silicon Graphics, Inc. not be used in advertising\r\n * or publicity pertaining to distribution of the software without specific,\r\n * written prior permission. \r\n *\r\n * THE MATERIAL EMBODIED ON THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS-IS\"\r\n * AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE,\r\n * INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR\r\n * FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
